## Lessons Learned

**Q:** What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

**A:** While building this project, I learned the importance of clearly mapping out my ideas before beginning this project. Also, the necessity of continuously working to improve this report. 

In terms of challenges, I originally used bar charts to display my data. However, I wanted to push myself to upgrade my visualizations and utilize new ways of displaying my data. Lollipop charts are just as effective as bar graphs and are aesthetically pleasing as well.
